This is my project to build device for measure contactless of human temperature. The device has an integration with automatic handsanitizer and rfid attendance system.
### The firmware uses several libraries, including:
1. Adafruit MLX90614 Library (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-MLX90614-Library/)
2. DFRobot DFPlayer Mini Library (https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobotDFPlayerMini/archive/1.0.3.zip)
3. LiquidCrystal I2C Library (https://github.com/johnrickman/LiquidCrystal_I2C)
4. NewPing Library (https://github.com/microflo/NewPing)
5. Servo Library (built-in Arduino)
6. Software Serial Library (built-in Arduino)
